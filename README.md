I'm in a journey in becoming a Full Stack Developer. My specialties lies in Java, DBMS and Spring boot. I use Eclipse IDE for my backend development and for the frontend development React JS is my first option. In constructing, the frontend counterpart, I have used ExtJS6 as well as HTML-CSS-JavaScript.
OOPs projects are my all time favorites.
